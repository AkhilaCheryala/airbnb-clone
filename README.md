# Technologies Used

To create this website, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
## Description

- HTML was primarily used for building the structural foundation of the website, defining elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, forms, and overall layout organization.

- Bootstrap was chosen for its comprehensive collection of components and utilities. Specifically, I utilized Bootstrap for integrating icons seamlessly into the design, enhancing navigation and providing visual cues throughout the website.

- CSS played a crucial role in styling and customization. It was utilized extensively to design various components, including buttons, forms, navigation bars, and overall layout adjustments. Custom CSS rules were applied to achieve the desired visual aesthetics and user interface enhancements.

- JavaScript was employed for implementing dynamic functionalities and interactivity. It facilitated features such as form validation, image sliders, modal dialogs, and other interactive elements, thereby enhancing user engagement and experience.
